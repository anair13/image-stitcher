image-stitcher
==============

WIP image stitching project by Ashvin Nair and Roy Tu in Python.

Source explanation:
- `source.py` interfaces with Panoramio to grab images.
- `detect.py` does feature detection with the OpenCV SURF algorithm.
- `match.py` finds matching features and correlates images
